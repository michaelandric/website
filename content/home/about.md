# Biography

My background includes Psychology, Neuroscience, Data Science, Analytics, Psycholinguistics, and collabortaions in computer science. Those are the areas in which I have some to expert (PhD) formal training and experience. See my [resume](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0By9vvQ5RjgcMaVJqSFY4N09kYUU). I'm also interested in artificial intelligence and basketball â€“ not necessarily together but maybe we'll get there.
