# Biography

My background includes Psychology, Neuroscience, Data Science, Analytics, Psycholinguistics, and collabortaions in computer science. Those are the areas in which I have some to expert (PhD) formal training and experience. See my [resume](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0By9vvQ5RjgcMemZuQThiT19aU2s). I'm also interested in artificial intelligence and basketball â€“ not necessarily together but maybe we'll get there. 

<!---
I've always been after ways to understand why people do what they do. I pursued this first in Psychology coursework, starting in high school and then as my major in college. At UC Santa Cruz, I studied metaphor and its basis as a conceptual framework for how we understand and behave in the world. While researching this, however, I questioned whether our behaviors relied on more mechanistic factors and whether there underlay a more reliable ground truth. I turned towards neuroscience and developing an undestanding of the interface between brain and behavior.
