Within the Computational Neuroscience Applications Research Infrastructure (CNARI) we developed a scalable framework for research and analysis that aims to manage neuroscience tools and the heterogeneous compute resources (such as Grids and clusters) on which they can be used, to enable large-scale computational projects in the neuroscience community.
