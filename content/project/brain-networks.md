This work investigates the brain's network organization. Much of this research centers on understanding large-scale (whole-brain) networks of brain function when people engage in higher-order cognitive tasks, such as statistical learning, or processing interpersonal communication. In these studies, we developed created workflows and measures to quantify changes in the statistical properties of large-scale networks. In addition to studies of functional brain organization, we extended these measures to characterize organizational differences in anatomical network of a congenitally blind population.

These measures largely derive from applications of graph theory and network science. They incorporate both original code [(for example)](https://github.com/michaelandric/hel-con/blob/master/graph_evals.py) and implementations of the [brain connectivity toolbox](https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/).
